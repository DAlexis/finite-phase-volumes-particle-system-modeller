finite-phase-volumes-particle-system-modeller
=============================================

This is a software to model multi-fractional systems using finite phase volumes method. The project consist of C++ library (./generator/indifferent) and automatic code generator written on Python2, than generates all C++ code needed to run model described in .yml file.

No I have not enough time to write any documentation. If you want some explanations how to use it, contact me (AlexeyABulatov@yandex.ru)
